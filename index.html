                Good morning, Babyyy.
                I know you get easily annoyed at me if I'm being too sweet especially when you're not in the mood... and honestly,
                <br><br>
                I think I do deserve it most of the times since I'm not stopping even after you already told me multiple times that you don't like it or that you're not in the mood.
                <br><br>
                But even if you're not in the mood right now or wala ka gana sakon I just want you to start this day knowing that
                <br><br>
                even when you're always annoyed, mad, wala gana, and tak an sakon, you're still the girl I'm grateful to wake up loving and the girl I'll always keep annoying forever HAHAHAHAHAHA.
                <br><br>
                I sometimes say things at the wrong time, or I do stupid things that trigger your mood, and kis a grabi maka pamilit simo HAHAHAHAHA.
                <br><br>
                I love you Rain, Including your mood swings, your "alabuton" moments, your sudden "sunggod", and your sharp little comments when you're mad.
                <br><br>
                Because all of those are part of the girl I chose. The girl who still makes my heart soften even when she's irritated at me.
                <br><br>
                The girl who doesn't need to force herself to be perfect for me. The girl whose presence, good moor or bad mood, still feels like home.
                <br><br>
                So even if today starts with you being moody, or mad at me, or even if I accidentally irritate you again, or I do it on purpose... I'll still be here, choosing you, loving you, understanding you, and holding on to you in the way you deserve.
                <br><br>
                You're my love, even when you're grumpy.
                <br><br>
                You're my peace, even when you're mad at me.
                <br><br>
                You're my person, in every version of you.
                <br><br>
                I hope you have a good morning love.
                And if it's not, I'm here - to ruin it even more.
                Char HAHAHAHAHAHA
                I'm here always love
